
This is a read me on how to get guided_lda working when the package will not successfully build wheels.

This is in no way meant to undermine the author of the guided_lda package or to replace it in anyway and is 
simply meant as a work around until the issue can be fully resolved.

1. Pull down the repository.

2. Install the original LDA package. 
	https://pypi.org/project/lda/
	
3. Drop the *.py files from the GuidedLDA_WorkAround repo in the lda folder under site-packages for your specific enviroment.

4. Profit...

EXAMPLE:


import numpy as np
from lda import guidedlda as glda
##from lda import glda_datasets as gldad
##X = gldad.load_data(gldad.NYT)
##vocab = gldad.load_vocab(gldad.NYT)</s>

## !!!! Update courtesy of @senjed !!!!

import lda.datasets as gldad
X = gldad.load_reuters()
vocab = gldad.load_reuters_vocab()

word2id = dict((v, idx) for idx, v in enumerate(vocab))
print(X[:10])




print("TESTING....")
